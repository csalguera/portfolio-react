      <h2>Journey</h2>
      <p className={styles["journey-text"]}>I have always been fascinated by the STEM fields since I was a kid, excelling in mathematics and physics. Contrary to my inclination, I spent my adulthood working in the food industry. Throughout 2018 until the end of 2019 I attended IvyTech to study Electrical Engineering. Due to unforeseen circumstances, I put my education on hold to focus on my career. I received multiple promotions but ultimately concluded that I was not satisfied. In November of 2022, I made the decision to pursue Software Engineering. I graduated from General Assembly in March of 2023 and now seek a full-time opportunity to showcase what I have learned.</p>
